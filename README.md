# Spam-Email-Classification
## Overview
This project aims to classify emails into spam or non-spam (ham) categories using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to build a model that effectively distinguishes between spam and legitimate emails using text classification algorithms.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing email text data for analysis.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Model Building**: Implementing and training multiple classification models, including Naive Bayes.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations**: Providing insights through confusion matrix, ROC curve,  and word clouds.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of emails labeled as spam or ham. The CSV file contains features extracted from emails, including their content and labels.
